This is a mask R-CNN that detects and segments breast cancer tumors from ultrasound images. The [model](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) is from matterport and was built on FPN and ResNet 101. I sampled my data from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6906728/) and annotated them with [VGG Image Annotator](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/). I would recommend training for at least 50 epochs if you start from pretrained MS COCO weights.
